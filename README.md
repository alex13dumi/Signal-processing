# Signal-processing
This repository contains signal processing project that uses Matlab.

Prerequisites for running:
* Matlab

Given N you can represent x(t) based on its formula from the image below.

The files were created for:
* Representing x(t) in Matlab ( x(t) from x(t).png). 
* Constructing and representing graphically in Matlab the signals xi(t), yi(t), zi(t) for 37 periods.
* Constructing the single-phase and double-phase rectified signals and representing graphically for each of the signals xi (t), yi (t), zi(t).
* Analyzing analytically the continuous component(CC) for xi(t), yi(t), zi(t).
* Representing the signals xi(t), yi(t), zi(t) without CC.
* Writing a program in Matlab that calculates CC with an accuracy of 10E-7.
* Calculating the power over a period for xi(t), yi(t), zi((t).

Note: RMA = Single Phase Rectification, RDA = Double Phase Rectification.
